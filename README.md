# DSA-Patterns---Learning-Basics
As I am new to DSA, I am learning these patterns and I will keep uploading more soon ...

This is basically the first time when I am posting something that matters. As a begineer I was always like, posting something here might not be appropriate because this is very basic stuff. But whatever, I will keep posting here to make good repositories and soon I will be able to post more advanced programs here ...
